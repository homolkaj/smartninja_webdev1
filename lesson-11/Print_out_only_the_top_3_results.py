# Add unsuccessful guesses into the dictionary For now our game only stores the number of attempts and
# the date. Let's also store the name of the player and the secret number in each game. During the game,
# collect user's unsuccessful guesses and then store them in the dictionary under the name "wrong_guesses". Now that
# we removed the score_list.sort() line (because it doesn't work with dictionaries in the list), we have to find
# another way to sort the scores. There are many ways how to do it. Use your imagination (and Google) and try to
# figure out at least one of them. :)

# we now want to incorporate the time of the high score
# into the high score list
# for this we need the datetime library

# Homework 12.5: Make the guessing game more modular
#
#Use functions to make the game more modular.
# Use functions to make the game more modular.
# Also try to add another while loop so the user can play many rounds of the game without having to re-run the program each time.
# Hint, the game would look something like this:
#
#while True:
#    selection = input("Would you like to A) play a new game, B) see the best scores, or C) quit?")
#
#    if selection == "A":
#        play_game()
#    elif selection == "B":
#        for score_dict in get_top_scores():
#            print(str(score_dict["attempts"]) + " attempts, date: " + score_dict.get("date"))
#    else:
#        break
#
#And you'll probably need three functions:
#   play_game()
#   get_score_list()
#   get_top_scores()
